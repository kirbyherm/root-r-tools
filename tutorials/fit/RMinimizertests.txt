problems with:

ConfidenceInterval.C
   the confidence interval for the gaussian was very wrong, simply filled in the area under the curve....

ErrorIntegral.C
   received the following error:
      "Warning in <TF1Helper::INtegralError>: Last used fitter does no provide parameter errors and a covariance matrix"
   additionally NCalls was inexplicably 0....

FittingDemo.C
   visually, fit seemed to be less accurate than the minuit fit

TestBinomial.C
   received a segmentation violation when fit was attempted....

exampleFit3D.C
   again a problem with NCalls being 0, must be a bug in the interface
   errors also left off of the fit values....

fit1.C
   differed significantly from the function.... major problem here

fit2dHist.C
   ranges of fits and their accuracies varied wildly in this test



success with:

fit2.C
   fit seemed to be even more precise than the minuit


extraneous problem:

TwoHistoFit2D.C
   received an error with both minimizations of 
      Do global fit
      Error: Symbol vector<std::pair<double is not defined in current scope  TwoHistoFit2D.C:147:

combinedFit.C 
   received an error with both minimizations of 
      Error: Can't call Fitter::FitFCN(6,globalChi2,0,dataB.Size()+dataSB.Size(),true) in current scope combinedFit.C:115:
